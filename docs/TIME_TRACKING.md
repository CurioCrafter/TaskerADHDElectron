# Time Tracking System - ADHD-Focused Design

## üß† Why Time Tracking Matters for ADHD

### Core ADHD Challenges Addressed
- **Time Blindness**: Difficulty estimating how long tasks actually take
- **Hyperfocus**: Getting absorbed in work and losing track of time
- **Task Switching**: Trouble transitioning between different activities  
- **Executive Function**: Difficulty with planning and organizing work sessions

## üéØ Key Use Cases

### 1. Reality Check for Time Estimates
**Problem**: "This will take 30 minutes" ‚Üí Actually takes 3 hours
**Solution**: Track actual vs estimated time to build time awareness
**Benefit**: More accurate planning and realistic scheduling

### 2. Hyperfocus Management  
**Problem**: Working for 6 hours straight without breaks
**Solution**: Gentle alerts when focused too long, optional session limits
**Benefit**: Prevents burnout and maintains sustainable work habits

### 3. Context Switching Analysis
**Problem**: Not realizing how much time is lost switching between tasks
**Solution**: Track time gaps between tasks, measure setup/warmup time
**Benefit**: Better understanding of workflow efficiency

### 4. Energy Level Correlation
**Problem**: Not knowing when you're most productive
**Solution**: Track time + energy levels to find optimal work periods  
**Benefit**: Schedule important tasks during peak energy times

### 5. Progress Visualization
**Problem**: Procrastination and lack of progress awareness
**Solution**: Visual time logs showing daily/weekly accomplishments
**Benefit**: Builds momentum and provides dopamine hits from visible progress

### 6. Professional Communication
**Problem**: Difficulty explaining where time was spent
**Solution**: Detailed time logs with task breakdowns
**Benefit**: Professional credibility and accurate time reporting
